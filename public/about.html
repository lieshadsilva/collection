<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello there! Welcome to my GitHub page, where I'm delighted to share my experiences as a web designer. 
  My name is Liesha Dsilva, and I'm currently stumbling my way through the world of web development.
   I'm happy to be able to share my progress with you via this platform.</p>

<p>As an enthusiastic novice, I mostly concentrate on HTML, the foundation of web design. 
  With a solid HTML foundation, I believe in writing clean, structured code that serves as the cornerstone for outstanding user experiences. 
  I am continually polishing my HTML skills and keeping up with the most recent best practises.
  In addition to HTML, I am actively learning CSS and JavaScript to broaden my web design talents. 
  I hope to create compelling and dynamic user experiences using these technologies.</p>

<p>I plan to share my portfolio on GitHub, highlighting the projects I've worked on during my learning experience. 
  It will be a testament to my development and the wide range of projects I work on. 
  I hope you find them useful, motivating, and a true reflection of my commitment to this profession.
  I'm always open to new partnerships and comments, so do get in touch if you have any ideas, questions, or opportunities.
   Let's connect and learn as we explore the amazing world of web design and development!</p>

<p>Thank you for joining me on this journey, and I look forward to sharing my progress with you.</p>
<p>
Happy coding!<br/>
